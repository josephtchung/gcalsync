Create a Chrome extension that works with multiple google calendars to automatically sync entries in
specific calendars into a single master calendar.

The problem I want to solve is that I have mutiple personal calendars that are shared to my work
calendar. Although I can see all of my entries in my work calendar, my colleagues cannot see them
and will schedule meetings at times that collide with these personal entries.

I want an extension or other kind of service that periodically syncs these calendar entries into
my work calendar displaying them as "busy" (i.e. not with the actual contents of the calendar entry)
so that my work colleagues cannot schedule meetings that collide.
